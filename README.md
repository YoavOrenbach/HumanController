<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project is to allow dexterity challenged individuals who cannot operate a keyboard, mouse or any controller properly to play video games using body poses.
You can choose any pose you like, map it to any keyboard or mouse input and play your favourite games with your desired poses at no extra cost.

There are 3 steps in order to use Human Controller:
1. Take poses you would like to use in game and map them to any keyboard or mouse input.
